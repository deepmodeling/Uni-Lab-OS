Uni-Lab-OS License Agreement

Preamble
This License Agreement (the "Agreement") is instituted to govern user conduct and obligations in relation to the utilization of the Uni-Lab-OS (the "Software"). By accessing, downloading, installing, or utilizing the Software in any manner, you hereby acknowledge that you have meticulously reviewed, comprehended, and consented to be legally bound by the terms herein. If you dissent from any provision of this Agreement, you must forthwith cease all interaction with the Software.

1. Grant of License
1.1 The proprietary rights to the Software are exclusively retained by Beijing DP Technology Co., Ltd. ("DP Technology"). Subject to full compliance with this Agreement, DP Technology hereby grants academic users ("Licensee") a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to untilise the Software solely for non-commercial academic pursuits.

1.2 The foregoing license applies exclusively to the Software's executable binary code. No rights whatsoever are conferred to the Software's source code.

2. Usage Restrictions
2.1 This license is restricted to academic users engaging in scholastic activities. Commercial entities, institutions, or any non-academic parties are expressly prohibited from utilizing the Software. Violations of this clause shall entitle DP Technology to pursue all available legal remedies.
2.2 The Licensee shall obtain a commercial license from DP Technology for any commercial use of the Software.
2.3 The Licensee shall not utilise the Software or any derivative works for commercial purposes, nor distribute, sublicense, lease, transfer, or otherwise disseminate the Software to third parties. The Licensee is strictly prohibited from utilizing the Software for the benefit of any third-party entity, whether gratuitously or otherwise.
2.4 Reverse engineering, decompilation, disassembly, code isolation, or any attempt to derive source code from the Software is strictly prohibited. The Licensee shall not alter, circumvent, or remove copyright notices, trademarks, or proprietary legends embedded in the Software. Use of the Software for unlawful activities—including but not limited to intellectual property infringement or privacy violations—is categorically barred.
2.5 The Licensee warrants that the Software shall be utilised solely for lawful academic purposes in compliance with applicable jurisdictional statutes. All legal liabilities arising from noncompliance shall be borne exclusively by the Licensee.

3. Proprietary Rights
This Agreement confers a license to utilise the Software, not a transfer of ownership. All intellectual property rights—including copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and documentation—remain the exclusive dominion of DP Technology. The Licensee acquires no entitlements beyond the limited usage privileges expressly delineated herein.

4. Derivative Work
You may convey a work based on the Software, or the modifications to produce it from the Software, provided that you meet all of these conditions:
4.1 The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
4.2 The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License.
4.3 You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
4.4 If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Software has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

5. Feedback and Proposals
Licensees may submit proposals, suggestions, or improvements pertaining to the Software ("Feedback") under the following conditions:
(a) Licensee represents and warrants that such Feedback does not infringe upon any third-party intellectual property rights;
(b) Licensee acknowledges that DP Technology reserves the right, but assumes no obligation, to utilize such Feedback;
(c) Licensee irrevocably grants DP Technology a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide, sublicensable copyright license to reproduce, distribute, modify, publicly perform or display, translate, create derivative works of, commercialize, and otherwise exploit the Feedback in any medium or format, whether now known or hereafter devised, including the right to grant multiple tiers of sublicenses to enable such activities;
(d) Licensee hereby grants DP Technology a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Feedback and such Derivative Works, where such license applies only to those patent claimss licensable by Licensee that are necessarily infringed by the Feedback(s) alone or by comibination of the Feedback(s) with the Software to which such Feedback(s) were submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against Licensee or any other entity (including a cross-claim orcounterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Feedback, or the Software to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted under this Agreement for the Feedback or Software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
(e) Licensee hereby waives all claims, proprietary rights, or restrictions related to DP Technology's use of such Feedback.

While redistributing the Software or Derivative Works thereof, Licensee may act only on Licensee's own behalf and on Licensee's sole responsibility, not on behalf of DP Technology or any other Licensee.
